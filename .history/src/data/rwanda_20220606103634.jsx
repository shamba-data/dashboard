        text: "Rwanda is a landlocked country in the Great Lakes region of East Africa. Its 26,338 square kilometers 
        are dominated by highlands, giving it the name “Land of A Thousand Hills”. The lowest altitude in the country is 950 m above the sea level and it is estimated that 90% of domestic cropland is on slopes ranging from 5% to 55%. Rwanda’s climate is conditioned by its landscape: the lower the altitude, the warmer the temperature. The country experiences a long dry season from June to August with heavy rainfall between March and May.

        With 441 inhabitants per square kilometer, Rwanda had the second highest population density in Africa as of 2015. In the last 10 years the population grew at a rate of 2.6%, and reached an estimated 11.61 million inhabitants in 2015."
